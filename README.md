# React Three Fiber Car Mini Game

This small app was made via a tutorial provided by Irradiance on YouTube

## I am using this as specific practice for the following implementations:

1. load 3d objects into the scene
2. use physics and collisions in a scene
3. create complex lighting in a scene
4. user controls on a 3d object
